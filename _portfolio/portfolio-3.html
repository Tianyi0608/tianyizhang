<strong>One sentence summary:</strong> Augment question-answer pairs with semantic and syntactic constraints to solve the argument role labeling task.


This work explores the <strong>QA augmentation for events in news articles</strong>. Our altimate goal is to automatically extract structured events from unlabeled unstructured articles. In this work, we focus on a subtask: extract QA pairs for arguments given an event. The synthetic data severs as augmented data to train the QA event extraction model.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><text style="color:deeppink;">They</text> were married in <text style="color:dodgerblue;">Spain</text>.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><text style="color:deeppink;">Person-Argument</text></td>
    <td>Who is married?</td>
    <td>They</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><text style="color:dodgerblue;">Place-Argument</text></td>
    <td>Where is someone married?</td>
    <td>Spain</td>
  </tr>
</table>

 The people who are married
 Where the marriage takes place

Traditionally, to extract event QA pairs from an article, our steps are: ask questions --> extract answers. However, to augment event QA pairs, we propose a reversed approach: extract answers --> ask questions.

<p><strong>One sentence summary:</strong> Four stages event schema induction with GPT-3 and human curation.</p>

<p>This work explores a <strong>human-computer interactive</strong> way to build an <strong>event schema</strong>. Event Schema is a structured graph representation of events, analogical to knowledge graph. To clearly guide a machine and human for schema induction, we divide the task into four sequential stages: step generation, node extraction, graph construction, and node grounding.</p>

<!--  For example, event_searching contains subject: person_1 and object: item_1; then event_find with subject: person_1 and object: item_1. It focuses on the relationship between events, e.g., before and after, connected by the co-reference entities between events, e.g., person_1, item_1. -->

<pre><code># toy sample of an event schema.
# <b>temporal relation:</b> <text style="color:dodgerblue;">searching</text> event happens before <text style="color:dodgerblue;">find</text> event.
# <b>co-reference of entities:</b> <text style="color:darkturquoise;">subject: person_1</text> and <text style="color:deepskyblue;">object: item_1</text> are shared in two events.

<b style="color:dodgerblue;">event_searching</b>(<text style="color:darkturquoise;">subject: person_1</text> ; <text style="color:deepskyblue;">object: item_1</text>) &rarr; <b style="color:dodgerblue;">event_find</b>(<text style="color:darkturquoise;">subject: person_1</text> ; <text style="color:deepskyblue;">object: item_1</text>)</code></pre>

<p>Our approach is proposed based on the observations that automatic schema induction can be productive but vulnerable in quality; whereas manual schema induction can be accurate but onerous. We combine the work of humans and computers to generate event schemas in <strong>high efficiency (quality and quantity)</strong>.</p>

<strong>One sentence summary:</strong> Reasoning on the changes of entities and states when performing an action in symbolic language.

This work explores the <strong>causal reasoning of events</strong>. It treats causal links as the <strong>pre- and post-conditions between actions</strong>, represented in the symbolic language. For example, an action <em>go</em> requires (as pre-condition) an <em>avatar 1</em> at <em>location 1</em> and <em>location 1</em> can be connected to <em>location 2</em>; the result is (as post-condition) an <em>avatar 1</em> at <em>location 2</em>. To implement a sequence of actions, the pre-conditions should be satisfied before executing each action, and the post-conditions will be acquired after the action.

<code>
<pre>(: action go
	parameters: avatar_1, location_1, location_2
	pre-conditions: (avatar_1 at location_1) (location_1 connect to location_2)
	post-conditions: (avatar_1 at location_2)
)</code></pre>

The core theory of this approach is <strong>tracking the dynamics</strong> of <strong>entities</strong> and <strong>their attributes</strong>, such as <code>avatar 1</code> with attribute <code>at location 1</code> or <code>at location 2</code>, in a series of unit actions. We decompose a complicated goal into a bunch of reusable unit actions, e.g. <code>go</code>, <code>get</code>. The unit action is viewed as an external method to alter the internal states of the entity. Our focus is on the dynamics of entity states.

<code><pre>
init: (avatar_1 at location_1)
go: (avatar_1 at location_2) # avatar_1's location attribute changes from location_1 to location_2
get: (avatar_1 has item_1) # avatar_1's inventory attribute adds item_1
goal: (avatar_1 has item_1)</code></pre>

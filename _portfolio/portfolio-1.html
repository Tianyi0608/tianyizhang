<p><strong>One sentence summary:</strong> Reasoning on the changes of entities and states when performing an action in symbolic language.</p>

<p>This work explores the <strong>causal reasoning of events</strong>. It treats causal links as the <strong>pre- and post-conditions between actions</strong>, represented in the symbolic language. To implement a sequence of actions, the pre-conditions should be satisfied before executing each action, and the post-conditions will be acquired after the action. We generate the pre- and post-conditions of actions. Then, a PDDL solver finds a path to achieve a goal.</p>

<code><pre>
# An action <em>go</em> requires (as pre-condition) an <em>avatar 1</em> at <em>location 1</em> and <em>location 1</em> can be connected to <em>location 2</em>; 
# the result is (as post-condition) an <em>avatar 1</em> at <em>location 2</em>.

(: action go
	parameters: avatar_1, location_1, location_2
	pre-conditions: (avatar_1 at location_1) (location_1 connect to location_2)
	post-conditions: (avatar_1 at location_2)
)</code></pre>

<p>The core theory of this approach is <strong>tracking the dynamics</strong> of <strong>entities</strong> and <strong>their attributes</strong>, such as <em>'avatar 1'</em> with attribute <em>'at location 1'</em>, in a series of unit actions. It decomposes the accomplishment of a complicated goal into the fulfilment of a series of reusable unit actions (with particular conditions), e.g. <em>'go'</em>.</p>

<!--  The unit action is viewed as an external method to alter the internal states of the entity. Our focus is on the dynamics of these entity states. -->

<code><pre>
init: (avatar_1 at location_1)
go: (avatar_1 at location_2) # avatar_1's location attribute changes from location_1 to location_2
get: (avatar_1 has item_1) # avatar_1's inventory attribute adds item_1
goal: (avatar_1 has item_1)</code></pre>

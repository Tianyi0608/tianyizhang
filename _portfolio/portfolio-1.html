<p><strong>One sentence summary:</strong> Augment question-answer pairs with semantic and syntactic constraints to solve the argument role labeling task.</p>

<p><b>[What:]</b> This work explores the <strong>QA augmentation for events in news articles</strong>. Our altimate goal is to automatically extract structured events from unlabeled unstructured articles. In this work, we focus on a subtask: extract QA pairs for the arguments given an event. The synthetic data then severs as augmented data to train the QA event extraction model.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3"><text style="color:deeppink;">They</text> were married in <text style="color:dodgerblue;">Spain</text>.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<th>Arument Role Label</th>
  	<th>Question</th>
  	<th>Answer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><text style="color:deeppink;">Person-Arg</text></td>
    <td>Who is married?</td>
    <td>They</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><text style="color:dodgerblue;">Place-Arg</text></td>
    <td>Where is someone married?</td>
    <td>Spain</td>
  </tr>
</table>

 <!-- The people who are married
 Where the marriage takes place -->

<p><b>[Why:]</b> Traditionally, to extract structured event QA pairs from an article, the steps are: <b style="background-color:whitesmoke;">ask questions &rarr; extract answers</b>. However, to augment event QA pairs, we propose a reversed approach: <b style="background-color:whitesmoke;">extract answers &rarr; ask questions</b>. This approach takes advantage of the transfer ability of QA datasets and circumvents the high proportion (~60&percnt;) of no-answer questions.</p>

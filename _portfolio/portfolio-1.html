This work explores the <strong>causal reasoning of events</strong>. It treats causal links as the <strong>pre- and post-conditions between actions</strong>, represented in the symbolic language. For example, an action 'go' requires (as pre-condition) an 'avatar 1' at 'location 1' and 'location 1' can be connected to 'location 2'; the result is (as post-condition) an 'avatar' at 'location 2'. To implement a sequence of actions, the pre-conditions should be satisfied before executing each action, and the post-conditions will be acquired after the action. 

<pre>
<code>(: action go
	parameters: avatar_1, location_1, location_2
	pre-conditions: (avatar_1 at location_1) (location_1 connect to location_2)
	post-conditions: (avatar_1 at location_2)
	)</code>
</pre>

The core theory of this approach is <strong>tracking the dynamics</strong> of <strong>entities</strong> and <strong>their attributes</strong>, such as 'avatar 1' with attribute 'at location 1' or 'at location 2', in a series of unit actions. We decompose a complicated goal into a bunch of reusable unit actions, e.g. 'go', 'get'. The unit action is viewed as an external method to alter the internal states of the entity. Our focus is on the dynamics of entity states.

<pre><code>init: (avatar_1 at location_1)
go: (avatar_1 at location_2) # avatar_1's location attribute changes from location_1 to location_2
get: (avatar_1 has item_1) # avatar_1's inventory attribute adds item_1
goal: (avatar_1 has item_1)</code></pre>

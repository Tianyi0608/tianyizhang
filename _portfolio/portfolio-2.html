title: "Human-in-the-loop Schema Induction"
excerpt: ""

This work explores a human-computer interactive way to build an event schema. Event Schema is a structured graph representation of events, analogical to knowledge graph. For example, event_searching contains subject: person_1 and object: item_1; then event_find with subject: person_1 and object: item_1. It focuses on the relationship between events, e.g., before and after, connected by the co-reference entities between events, e.g., person_1, item_1.
<br/>
Our approach is proposed based on the observations that automatic schema induction can be productive but vulnerable in quality; whereas manual schema induction can be accurate but onerous. We combine the work of humans and computers to generate event schemas in high efficiency.

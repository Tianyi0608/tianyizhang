<strong>One sentence summary:</strong> Four stages event schema induction with GPT-3 and human curation.

This work explores a <strong>human-computer interactive</strong> way to build an <strong>event schema</strong>. Event Schema is a structured graph representation of events, analogical to knowledge graph. For example, event_searching contains subject: person_1 and object: item_1; then event_find with subject: person_1 and object: item_1. It focuses on the relationship between events, e.g., before and after, connected by the co-reference entities between events, e.g., person_1, item_1.
<br/><br/>
Our approach is proposed based on the observations that automatic schema induction can be productive but vulnerable in quality; whereas manual schema induction can be accurate but onerous. We combine the work of humans and computers to generate event schemas in <strong>high efficiency (quality and quantity)</strong>. To clearly guide a machine and human for schema induction, we divide the task into four sequential stages: step generation, node extraction, graph construction, and node grounding.

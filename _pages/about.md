# Research Experience

1. **Research Assistant: NLP Group at UPenn**, May. 2022 -
    - Event schema generation using GPT-3
        - Design the scaffolds (cause, plan, procedure, effect, etc.) for GPT-3 to generate inclusive events
        - Apply SRL and constituency parsing to summarize and extract structured events
        - Build schema graphs by adding temporal relations to the events
        - Outcome: "Human-in-the-Loop Schema Induction" paper
    - Natural language to symbolic language translation for reasoning
        - Focus on open-domain natural language (wikiHow) to symbolic language (PDDL) generation with GPT-4
        - Decompose the task into three stages: extraction, inference, and translation
        - Identify strong text extraction and entity states inference abilities with increasingly complex wikiHow text (~5000 words)
        - Acknowledge a weak translation capability to predefined symbolic pattern
        - Improve the performance using CoT and instructions on translation.
        - Outcome:"PROC2PDDL"paper
2. **Research Assistant: Cognitive Computation Group at UPenn**, Mar. 2020 â€“ Dec. 2022
   
    - Event trigger identification and classification using sequence tagging
        > - 1-of-N (72) joint model and BIO identification + event type classification pipeline model</font>
        > - Transfer learning with target language auxiliary dataset, e.g. OntoNotes Arabic
    - Event argument identification and classification using QA
        - Design fixed questions for each argument role and convert argument role labeling task to question answering task
        - Has-and-no-answer joint model and has/no answer classification + has answer identification pipeline model
        - Transfer learning with auxiliary QA dataset, e.g. SQuAD, QAMR
    - Event data augmentation using answer extraction (AE) and question generation (QG)
        - Train AE-QG T5 model to extract QA pairs from unlabeled event text
        - Train AEwSRL-QG Bert and T5 model to extract QA pairs from unlabeled event text
        - Evaluate on joint-QA and pipeline-QA model and prove effectiveness of the above data augmentation approach
        - Paper in submission
